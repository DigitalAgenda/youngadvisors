# Young Advisors Group Proposals for VP Neelie Kroes

Young Advisors Expert Group, May 2013

*Background information: after the meeting between Neelie Kroes and the Young Advisors group on [March 4, 2013](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/minutes-1st-meeting-between-neelie-kroes-and-young-advisors-group-4-march-2013), VP Kroes challenged the group to come up with a list of things we would do if we were put in her place.*

## Basic infrastructure

### Find out through open data sources the full extent of the limited connectivity in Europe and publish it

This is not the data given to the regulators and governments by the telcos. They assume if a home/business is connected to an 'broadband enabled exchange' that the property has a fit for purpose connection. We need maps with circles round exchanges and cabinets on line length, as we know the physical capabilities of copper. Find out how many areas don't have cabinets. Find out which cabinets are being enabled. And publish it. This  data is hidden, as exchanges are enabled but not all cabinets are, and  once an exchange is enabled the stats say all the customers on it have  'access to superfast'. 

### Every EU citizen should have access to reliable broadband
We cannot put the cherry on the cupcake and get every citizen digital if those citizens do not have access to a connection that just works. Too many states and too many areas within those states are half baked buns. We must stop funding going into cherries and get the buns cooked, we need the infrastructure building and to do that we need to enable  altnets and people to build it themselves. Support measures such as access to dark fibre, use limited funding to get those connections to people, and let the people build their own networks for  the future. This also results in growing cohesion, civic pride and  ownership and more importantly it gets the job done, so the icing can be put on the cupcake. (ie industry and government reap the rewards of every citizen digital) and the cherry on the top is a happy user, with a connection that is fit for purpose.

## Entrepreneurship

### Make EU a startup friendly zone

The EC can't make decision on tax rates and other things like that  in member states, but perhaps it can put some pressure on states to  make life easier for startups or they'll all keep running to UK (best  case) or the US. Get in touch with investors overseas, ask their  opinions about what we could do to make EU startups more trustworthy. 

### Promote a real single market for eBusiness

It is important that the EU becomes a real single market. Currently it is not the case, and enterprises need to deal with different legislation, IP management ... per country. For small technological startups this is a serious barrier. We cannot compete as ecosystem with the US while, for a similar pool of potential clients (optimistic estimation), entrepreneurs there have to face a single administration, and here, a large number of them. 

### Promote a social entrepreneurship friendly Europe. Social businesses can have a great impact

Many countries in Central and Eastern Europe have large segments of population coping with chronic poverty. Social entrepreneurship initiatives are aimed at leveraging the economic potential of these groups while investing in medium and long term projects. There are however great local differences in terms of legal and policy support. Using their CSR budgets, corporations should provide expertise and financial support to generate local social businesses building cross sectoral collaborations locally.

### Encourage successful entrepreneurs to re-invest

Encourage the last generation of entrepreneurs to re-invest, teach and help the new generation. Speak to the founders of Skype, Bebo, Playfish and find out what they think. At the moment there is little to no knowledge of EU level support amongst fellow consumer web entrepreneurs in London. Those that know about it tend to think of government support as bureaucratic, time consuming and geared towards technical or academic research rather than consumer or commercial web startups. Could the EU funds help support more incubator programmes (like YCombinator, Seedcamp, etc) in Europe?

### Facilitate and support social innovation, creativity and collaborative business approaches 

Policy makers and the industry should support collaborative networks between Universities, NGOs and innovation incubators in order to optimize results and encourage start ups and entrepreneurship spirit. Young content producers and creators have innovative ideas and technologies, but the surrounding to enable the creative process and bring ideas into market should be facilitated by governments and the industry.

## Open data, transparency, free software

### Organize open data hackatons

It's great that we now have the open data portal, it's less great that it's incredibly clumsy to work with. We need an easier way to access and use the data (open APIs), so that citizens can come up with their own interesting projects. The EC should actively invite people to  come up with apps that use the data in a creative way (as a competition or open hackaton).

### More transparency and independent EU based control mechanisms

Looking around in different areas at stake â€“ security, copyright, broadband, skills, funding, ... one pattern appears: self-regulators regulate themselves. This is not a healthy development, and - as history shows - has spoiled development within Europe. In order to be more successful in future, industry (computer ind. and telcos alike) - should not be allowed to sit on the same table in different roles: on the money taking site as well as supervising where the money is spend on and how. An independent control mechanism is needed, in order to check delivered facts, avoid notions as  "i am too big to fail" and " the winner takes all". It also might be appealing for  SME's -  who don't have the manpower to travel to Brussels and to join meetings  - to talk and to be addressed by an independent, European body. 

Maybe a central register of results of all projects supported by EU would be helpful, too. Every citizen has the right to know how public sources are used. The register should be held at one site, on national level as well as on the EU level. This tool would also serve as platform for inspiration, promotion and sharing of good practices, human resources database. Some aggregator would maybe be sufficient.
  
### Force the governments to follow the law respecting to the use of free software

Governments are supposed to use free software, and thanks to the efforts done by the EU in the past years, some of them have created laws to ensure that free software is used in everything public. But that is not happening - for example in countries such as Spain, the government is not following its own laws regarding the use of free software. In Slovenia we still have examples of public services that basically require you to use Internet Explorer (a Windows only browser).

### Locked devices shouldn't be allowed in the EU

It's great that carrier locked mobile phones aren't allowed in the EU, the same should also go for other devices. Users must have the choice to switch OS or modify the software as needed. Now that Microsoft is scared by the EU, we should stop their Secure Boot craziness. What they're doing with the whole UEFI/Secure Boot thing is undoubtedly worse than what they did with Internet Explorer. It's a clear monopolistic situation that is stopping innovation and removing the freedom of the user to use whatever OS they want. It's crazy that totally locked computers are being sold right now in the EU.

## Copyright and single digital market

### Encourage digital solutions to digital issues 
The upside of the digital age is that we can track and report accurately on all content consumption (rather than random sampling). This could form the basis of a digital copyright exchange, as proposed by Prof. Hargreaves in a recent government review in the UK. If there was a clear and legal pan-European framework to license digital content, the number of new enterprises could blossom and this would be the biggest challenger to piracy. The difficulty is in convincing the rights owners to embrace the new technological developments, and building a framework which works across multiple territories.

### A  copyright system that copes with 21st century and single European digital market demands: strive to balance the right of citizens, artists, publishers, and service providers 

In order to create a truly european single market, the issue copyright needs to be solved. if one understands ICT as being all about information and who is in control of it, a fair solution for  all players need to be defined. One step forward can be to make the work of collecting societies and recording industry more transparent; right now it's a blackbox. Decipher myths by encouraging record industry and collecting society to open their books and to put it into the public domain. Nobody knows if what they claim is what they possess (record company) nor what they pay is what they receive (collecting society), the only thing we witness is the notion to bundle net & copyright laws for the purpose of surveillance/control.

### Look abroad at what works

In the USA there is a collecting society called SoundExchange whose rates and rules have been decided by Congress. This provides a stable legal framework for companies like Pandora to grow on. The only downside is that the legislation / rules have a hard time keeping up with technological developments (eg mobile). Here in the UK, Pearson (a publisher who owns FT, Penguin, etc) are keen to push for a digital rights exchange model, and I think that they exploring implementing one soon.

## Education, best practices and research

### Make ICT part of the entire school curriculum

ICT cannot be limited to just one class. ICT is a tool, not the end goal. For more suggestions, see our Education and ICT document. 

### Promote best practices from all over Europe, especially those originating from local communities 

Local, community organized events that promote areas related to the Digital Agenda need better exposure and promotion (for example: B4RN, CoderDojo, Rails Girls), so that individuals, who want to get involved, can easily borrow proven best practices from across Europe. This is perhaps something we, the YAGi can help with.

### Big ideas need support and funding for long term research

The EC needs to keep funding big ideas such as ones in the Future & Emerging Technologies programme that don't necessarily have immediate commercial potential, but have a lot of world-changing long term potential. Yet one needs to take care that  excessive administrative burden don't overshadow  scientific progress.  (over 80 partners for the human brain project, and over 100 for graphene can cause a bureaucratic hurdle).

## Special interest groups

### Protect the children wisely

We want an open and  free internet without government intervention, but there has to be a  mechanism to punish those who put content online which is harmful.

### Keep emphasizing the role of women in ICT

We  can't afford to leave half of the population behind. It's great that women in ICT are  emphasized, perhaps more could be again done to promote successful women and good practices that make STEM more appealing to women? An important piece of the puzzle are the various initiatives done on the local level, but we could always use more support from up above. We also believe it's important to include all women into these types of programs, not just young girls (although it is important to start early). Other important targets:

- Late years of secondary/high school, where final decision about studies is done.
- Unemployed women, both graduates and those who are looking for new career options. We could solve two big problems (unemployment  for women above 40; 35 in some countries & lack of ICT profiles) having actions in place to reconstruct professional path for this group.

### Digitally empower socially excluded groups, inter-ethnic minorities, disabled groups

Next year less than 10% of jobs will require no ICT skills whatsoever meanwhile socially excluded groups with low level or without any school education are highly attracted to the Internet as it provides the cheapest access to entertainment. A good example for the power of digital literacy skills is in the Roma/Gypsy population where EU, state and privately funded social inclusion initiatives did not manage to decrease the illiteracy rate in Roma communities however Youtube, Facebook and Kaskosan content made tens of thousands of individuals learn read and type on computers. Telcos and corporations should develop targeted packages so such groups can get connected to the Internet, can aquire digital literacy skills and can become actors of the evolving digital economy. Digital empowerment will boost social integration.

### Encourage flexible working options

With respect to oncoming lack of qualified HR for ICT sector, more intensive support for the flexible work forms - especially teleworking - would be highly appreciated. Many ICT specialists can do their job during their free time or evenings. Telework allows also women during or after their maternity leave to stay in touch with their professional occupation and combine their family needs and career in comfortable way. It helps socially excluded and disabled groups and people living in regional areas with high unemployment to get job and increase their living standard.
  
### Eradicate age discrimination

It's pretty stupid to use prejudice against the youth not letting them doing a lot of things. Age is a number, and we should not judge anyone by it. We should eradicate this kind of discrimination in order to have a better youth. If we need any method for measuring if a person if mature enough for driving a car or start a business etc. we need a method that it's not a generalization by itself.

## General advice

### Keep listening to expert groups like YAG that aren't part of traditionally powerful lobby groups

Getting advice and opinions outside the political bubble should be common practice. Getting diverse opinions is important if we want to provide solutions that will benefit all, not just the privileged ones. Young people are, for instance, already doing a lot; policy makers are often out of touch and do not know about what young people are already doing and achieving.

### Get more whiteboards in Brussels, give out free copies of Lean Startup 

A  more friendly environment stimulates sharing and better ideas. If possible, give people more freedom to work more efficiently in small,  lean group. Jordan's group in the UK GOV is a great example for that and could be a great model for other institutions

### Mindset change: making failure easier to deal with on all levels

A not very short-term and quite difficult to achieve one would be start educating new generations to lose fear to fail. Maybe with big scale conferences where politicians, entrepreneurs, industry + scientists talk about where they failed and why; what lessons they have learned ("Failed and Learned"). Change our attitude towards failing, and feel it not as a disgrace that marks the individual for life, but as an opportunity to learn. Teach the next generation to deal with it in a positive way. Reform international, national and local public funding structures and measures where you primarily support startups to succeed and not to sanction failures. Today European funding programs first want to make sure that none steals public money, and 2nd that we succeed.

### Intercontinental cooperation

In connection to existing technology and economics trends, some development of models for fruitful, EU-positive, intercontinental, overseas cooperation should be considered.
